# RTOS
Porting typical open source RTOS to STM32 platform.

In the future research and study of Cortex-M series CPUs, I will mainly use 32F469IDISCOVERY evaluation board. The F4 series' most powerful STM32F469NI is used to support many peripheral devices including TFT-LCD. Detailed information about this MCU can refer to the following website.
